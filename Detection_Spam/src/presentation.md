1. Goal (classify spam)
2. pedestrian approach (grab all words)
    - too much processing, 55k columns
    - worked ish, 85% accuracy on data which was captured. only took 0.1,0.9 and 0.9,0.1 since processing was ridiculous
3. smarter approach (with feature engineering)
    - compare emails individually, grab nearest neighbours (much faster)
    - discuss papers
4. statistics on feature engineering
